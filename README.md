## Project Overview

The Maven Coffee Sales dashboard was developed for Maven Roasters, a fictional coffee shop with operations in three locations in NYC. The dataset includes approximately 149,117 rows of observations, consisting of columns like transaction date, timestamp, transaction quantity, unit price, and location, as well as product-level details.

## Tasks

- How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?

- Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?

- What are the most and least frequently sold products? Which drives the most revenue for the business?

- Find out the monthly revenue performance of each store location.

- Weekday sales outperformed weekends, with Monday generating the highest revenue ($101.68k), while Saturday and Sunday had the lowest ($96.89k and $98.33k).

## Recommendations

- Introduce weekday promotions for lower-selling products to capitalize on higher weekday traffic and encourage upselling.
  
- Launch weekend marketing campaigns or special discounts to boost sales on Saturdays and Sundays when revenue is lower.
  
- Expand high-performing coffee product offerings or introduce premium variations to maximize revenue from the most popular category.
